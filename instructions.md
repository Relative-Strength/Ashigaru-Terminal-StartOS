**Ashigaru Terminal User Guide**
=====================================

**Introduction**
---------------

Ashigaru Terminal is a terminal-based application that enables users to participate in Whirlpool CoinJoin cycles with the goal of strengthening privacy in Bitcoin transactions.

**Key Features**
----------------

*   **Self-Custody**: Users retain complete control over their wallets and keys throughout the entire process.
*   **Privacy-Preserving**: Sensitive information such as master public keys or wallet structures remain private.
*   **Anonymity**: Connections are routed through Tor by default, preventing observers from linking activity to a particular IP address.

**Using Ashigaru Terminal**
---------------------------

### Pasting Content

To paste content into the web terminal:

*   On Windows or Linux, use `Ctrl+Shift+V`.
*   On macOS, use `Cmd+Shift+V`.

Note: In LibreWolf or Tor Browser, it may be necessary to disable 'resistFingerprinting' for the web terminal to function properly. Alternatively, you can use a Chromium-based browser such as Brave (even over tor).

### Connecting to an Electrum Server

To connect to an Electrum server over Tor within Ashigaru Terminal:

*   Enter the server's `.onion` address.
*   Select the correct Electrum port.
*   Enable the proxy with the address `127.0.0.1` and port `9050`.

### Important Notes

*   **Updates**: Updates may not retain existing wallets. Always back up your seed phrase securely, especially before upgrading or migrating.
