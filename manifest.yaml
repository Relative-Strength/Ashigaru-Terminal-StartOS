  long: |
    Participate in coordinated, Zerolink coinjoins by interacting with the Ashigaru Whirlpool protocol. Break all deterministic links whilst retaining full control of your coins.
    Ashigaru Terminal is a non-custodial, dedicated Ashigaru Whirlpool client which allows users to enter pools of their choice and continue to build their forward and backwards anonymity sets whilst being in full control of their funds during every stage of coinjoin cycles. There is no requirement to run your own Dojo server.
